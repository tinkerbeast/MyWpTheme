MyWpTheme
=========

MyWpTheme is a highly customisable WordPress theme based on Bootstrap 4.0. The project is still in development stage, and trying to get it to an alpha stage at least.

## Getting started for developers

You need [bower](https://bower.io/) installed on your system.

    ```bash
    # move to your wordpress testing themes directory
    $wp_test_installation/wp-content/themes/

    # run bower to get dependcies
    bower install
    ```

Now go into your WordPress admin console and select MyWpTheme.

## Bugs and features

Currently bugs and feature list is being manintained in the README-DEV.md folder. Until an alpha release happens, I'll stick to that only.
